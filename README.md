## **Java Programming module**

This repository contains a collection of java programs from my first program up until the end of the java module in first year.
Some of the programs are from coding along live in lectures, others are challenges and there are three which are my assessments.
The assessments that were examined are included and directories begin with  P1, P2 and P3 for the respective assessments (there were three in total for programming).

The three assessments were graded with final overall mark of 92%.
